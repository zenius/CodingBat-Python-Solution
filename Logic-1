#cigar_party 
When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. 
A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive. 
Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. 
Return True if the party with the given values is successful, or False otherwise.

Some Test Cases: 
cigar_party(30, False) → False
cigar_party(50, False) → True
cigar_party(70, True) → True

Solution: 
        def cigar_party(cigars, is_weekend):
          if is_weekend: 
            return cigars >= 40
          else:
            return cigars >= 40 and cigars <=60
            

#date_fashion 
You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. 
The parameter "you" is the stylishness of your clothes, 
in the range 0..10, and "date" is the stylishness of your date's clothes. 
The result getting the table is encoded as an int value with 0=no, 1=maybe, 2=yes. 
If either of you is very stylish, 8 or more, then the result is 2 (yes). 
With the exception that if either of you has style of 2 or less, then the result is 0 (no). 
Otherwise the result is 1 (maybe).

Some Test Cases: 
date_fashion(5, 10) → 2
date_fashion(5, 2) → 0
date_fashion(5, 5) → 1

Solution: 
        def date_fashion(you, date):
          if you <=2 or date <=2: 
            return 0
          if you >=8 or date >=8: 
            return 2
          else: 
            return 1

#squirrel_play 
The squirrels in Palo Alto spend most of the day playing. 
In particular, they play if the temperature is between 60 and 90 (inclusive).
Unless it is summer, then the upper limit is 100 instead of 90. 
Given an int temperature and a boolean is_summer, return True if the squirrels play and False otherwise.

Some Test Cases: 
squirrel_play(70, False) → True
squirrel_play(95, False) → False
squirrel_play(95, True) → True

Solution: 
        def squirrel_play(temp, is_summer):
          if is_summer: 
             return temp >=60 and temp<=100
          else: 
            return temp >=60 and temp<=90

#caught_speeding 
You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. 
Write code to compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. 
If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. 
If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2. Unless it is your birthday -- on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.

Some Test Cases: 
caught_speeding(60, False) → 0
caught_speeding(65, False) → 1
caught_speeding(65, True) → 0

Solution: 
        def caught_speeding(speed, is_birthday):
          speeding = speed - (65 if is_birthday else 60) 
          if speeding > 20: 
            return 2
          elif speeding > 0:
            return 1
          else: 
            return 0
            
#sorta_sum 
Given 2 ints, a and b, return their sum. However, sums in the range 10..19 inclusive, are forbidden,
so in that case just return 20.

Some Test Cases: 
sorta_sum(3, 4) → 7
sorta_sum(9, 4) → 20
sorta_sum(10, 11) → 21           
           
Solution: 
        def sorta_sum(a, b):
          return 20 if a + b in range(10,20) else a + b
          
#alarm_clock 
Given a day of the week encoded as 0=Sun, 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ...6=Sat,
and a boolean indicating if we are on vacation, 
return a string of the form "7:00" indicating when the alarm clock should ring. 
Weekdays, the alarm should be "7:00" and on the weekend it should be "10:00". 
Unless we are on vacation -- then on weekdays it should be "10:00" and weekends it should be "off".

Some Test Cases: 
alarm_clock(1, False) → '7:00'
alarm_clock(5, False) → '7:00'
alarm_clock(0, False) → '10:00'

Solution: 
        def alarm_clock(day, vacation):
          if vacation:
            return "off" if day ==0  or day==6 else "10:00"
          else: 
               return "7:00" if day!=0 and day!=6 else "10:00"

#love6 
The number 6 is a truly great number. Given two int values, a and b, return True if either one is 6. 
Or if their sum or difference is 6. Note: the function abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.

Some Test Cases: 
love6(6, 4) → True
love6(4, 5) → False
love6(1, 5) → True

Solution: 
        def love6(a, b):
            return a == 6 or b == 6 or a+b == 6 or abs(a-b) == 6
            
#in1to10 
Given a number n, return True if n is in the range 1..10, inclusive. 
Unless outside_mode is True, in which case return True if the number is less or equal to 1,or greater or equal to 10.

Some Test Cases: 
in1to10(5, False) → True
in1to10(11, False) → False
in1to10(11, True) → True

Solution: 
        def in1to10(n, outside_mode):
          if outside_mode: 
            return n <=1 or n >=10
          else: 
            return n >=1 and n<=10

#near_ten 
Given a non-negative number "num", return True if num is within 2 of a multiple of 10. 
Note: (a % b) is the remainder of dividing a by b, so (7 % 5) is 2. 

Some Test Cases: 
near_ten(12) → True
near_ten(17) → False
near_ten(19) → True

Solution: 
        def near_ten(num):
          return num%10 in [8,9,0,1,2]
